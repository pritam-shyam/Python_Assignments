### Observations and Experience IA04

After I read the instructions for the assignment, I wanted to approach using functions
for each output so that all the required fields for the output would be in the same
chuck of code. I figured if I did them separately it would be efficient and have an easy
understanding of the flow of variables. There were a few challenges that I faced relating
to efficiently parse .csv file. Making a list and dictionary for the variables that required
multiple columns of data to compute top ten results.

I made a sample subset to test my program. For the final run, I ran the entire input file
on my macbook pro and took about 6-9 minutes to complete. I did attempt to test the same
program and file on a PC and ran was running for 45 minutes and I had to leave the class
so could not get a completion on that.

Overall this was a very challenging assignment but a lot of lessons learned regarding
manipulating data in dictionary and joined lists and dictionary. To perform the computations
I wanted to try list comprehensions as they seem effective and mostly one-liners.
